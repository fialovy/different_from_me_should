### So what even is this?

A naive experiment. It might not be sound in any way. But it was fun and I still laughed.


I wanted to know if I could get various subreddits (especially political, religious,
or identity-related) to 'say the quiet part out loud' by finishing the simple sentence,
"Other people should...". What kinds of people (if by "kind of person", we mean
"poster or commenter in a particular subreddit") are more prescriptive than others? What
kinds of people want the best for others vs. mind their own business vs. wish ill
upon others more often?

(I was originally going to call it "People who are different from me should...", hence
the repository name.)


### How?

I used [praw](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/quick_start.html)
to easily access the Reddit API at the free tier and
[markovify](https://pypi.org/project/markovify/#basic-usage)
to eventually process the text I obtained from various subreddits, with a little
cleanup courtesy of [nltk](https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.tokenize.sent_tokenize.html).


### Is it even meaningful?
